"""Phase Gate — minimal PreToolUse + PostToolUse hook for atomic checklist model.

Replaces phase-compliance-enforcer.py (841 lines → ~120 lines).

HARD BLOCKS (PreToolUse exit code 2):
  1. Code write authorization — default-deny on Write/Edit to code files
     during BUILD sessions unless workspace contains plan-lock evidence (ADR/IC).
  2. Git commit gate — blocks git commit/push unless chain-evaluator reports
     complete (reads .chain-status.json).
  3. Pre-shutdown promotion gate — blocks SendMessage shutdown_request
     unless workspace has promotion + contamination + sycophancy sections.
  4. sed -i workspace/hooks scope — blocks sed -i on workspace.md, shared/
     workspace files, or /.claude/hooks/ paths. Uses shlex.split() argv
     tokenization (CAL[4]) — not raw regex. Backup-extension forms
     (-i.bak, -i '' + path) are permitted (they write to separate files).
  5. 06b pre-archive compilation gate — blocks archive operations unless
     workspace contains `## compilation-complete: [R-{review-id}]` header.
     Manual-override recovery: `## compilation-complete: [R-{id}, manual-override,
     reason: {reason}]`. Per ADR[6]/IC[6] (plan §P2.A row 119: BLOCK day-1).

SOFT WARNS (PostToolUse systemMessage):
  6. Context firewall — warns when personal context detected in workspace writes.

Everything else (phase skip, DA exit-gate, BELIEF-on-advance, CB evidence,
synthesis write, SendMessage dispatch) is handled by the chain-evaluator.py
Stop hook which evaluates completeness at session end.

    Backup-extension forms (``sed -i.bak``) pass per CAL[4] rationale:
    a real suffix produces a recoverable .bak copy on both GNU and BSD
    sed. In-place-no-backup forms (``sed -i``, ``sed -i ''``, ``sed
    --in-place``) are blocked — those are the R19 silent-overwrite
    shapes that cause data loss under concurrent workspace writes.

    these scopes are never blocked.

    KNOWN LIMITATION (ADR[SS-1] shlex.split argv scope):
    Paths supplied to sed via stdin — e.g. ``echo PATH | xargs sed -i
    'pattern'`` — are NOT visible to an argv scanner. They exist only
    at runtime, after this hook has decided. The following forms
    therefore bypass this check and could overwrite a protected path:

      - ``echo ~/.claude/teams/.../workspace.md | xargs sed -i 's/a/b/'``
      - ``find . -name '*.md' | xargs sed -i 's/a/b/'``
      - ``cat filelist.txt | xargs -n1 sed -i 's/a/b/'``

    Forms where the path IS in argv — including ``xargs -I{}`` with a
    literal operand after sed, ``env FOO=bar sed -i path``, and
    ``/abs/path/to/sed -i workspace.md`` — remain covered.

    Closing the stdin-piped gap requires runtime interception (a sed
    shim, a PreToolUse that re-parses stdin at exec time, or an OS
    monitor), all of which were explicitly out of ADR[SS-1] scope.
    If empirical incidents surface, a new SQ with ADR can address it.
    The CQA evasion-matrix test suite documents the bypass forms

    KNOWN LIMITATION (DA[#5] accept-with-documentation, C3-r1):
    This is a substring match against ``_ARCHIVE_PATH_MARKERS``. Forms
    that yield the same on-disk destination but a different argv string
    bypass this check and the surrounding BLOCK 5 gate:

      - **Symlinks**: ``ln -s archive/ /tmp/a`` then ``cp x /tmp/a/y``.
        The argv path ``/tmp/a/y`` doesn't contain any marker; the
        kernel resolves the symlink at write time, after the hook.
      - **Relative ``..`` traversal**: ``cd archive/.. && cp x archive/y``
        IS visible (marker still in argv). But ``cd archive/sub && cp x ../y``
        canonicalizes to an archive path while the argv ``../y`` does not.
      - **Case differences**: ``/SIGMA-REVIEW/SHARED/ARCHIVE/`` on a
        case-insensitive filesystem (default macOS HFS+/APFS) resolves
        to the same directory as the lowercase marker but fails the
        substring test (markers are lowercase). Unix and Linux are
        case-sensitive, so this is a macOS-specific bypass.

    Closing this gap requires path canonicalization (``os.path.realpath``
    + case-folding on macOS) before the marker check, plus a write-path
    check at exec time for symlink/cwd-relative forms. Both were out of
    ADR[6]/IC[6] day-1 scope. The day-1 BLOCK is plan-faithful per plan
    §P2.A row 119 and accepts this residual surface as documented.

    If empirical bypasses surface (operator reports an archive write that
    skipped the BLOCK), open a follow-up SQ for path canonicalization.
