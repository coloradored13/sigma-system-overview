SQ[TW-6] cross-ref grep-test: verifies "Step 7a" label appears only in BUILD contexts.

Companion to SQ[11] TestArchivedWorkspacePassthrough — documents the dual-test-SQ
structure (per audit PARTIAL-C remediation in plan §post-c1-audit-verdict).

Premise: per H7 r2 falsification, the Step 7a HARD GATE structure survives the
BUILD↔ANALYZE port, but the literal "Step 7a" label is dropped on the ANALYZE side
to avoid renumber-cascade across sigma-review/SKILL.md workflow steps. This test
enforces that label-drop mechanically.

Allowed locations for the literal "Step 7a" label:
  - sigma-build skill phase files (~/.claude/skills/sigma-build/phases/)
  - build-directives.md (~/.claude/teams/sigma-review/shared/build-directives.md)
  - controlled cross-references that explicitly call out the BUILD↔ANALYZE label
    distinction (these mention "Step 7a" while explaining ANALYZE drops the label)

Forbidden locations:
  - sigma-review skill phase/SKILL.md files as a step LABEL (mentions of "Step 7a"
    in cross-ref text are permitted; LABELS like "### Step 7a:" are not)
  - sigma-lead.md as a step LABEL on the ANALYZE-mode workflow

Anchor refs (plan): plan §P2.A row Files; ADR[H7] r2; c1-plan.md:62.
